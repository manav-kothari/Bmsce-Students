        Greetings from BMSCE IEEE!
        <br />
        The lockdown has been a buzzkill. But, we have something to lighten your
        mood and give your brain a little work. <br />
        So, fire up your neurons! <br />
        This is the trailer for an upcoming event. The catch is, the name of the
        event is in the form of various ciphers. The task here is to decipher it
        and mention at least 4 of the ciphers used.
        <br />
        The first 5 people to successfully complete this task will have an added
        advantage over the others in the actual event.
        <br />
        So, can you crack it?
        <br />
