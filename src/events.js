        Greetings from BMSCE IEEE!

        "An Investment in knowledge pays the best interests."
        <br />
        Keeping with the constant changes in technology can be quite a herculean
        task. Fret not! BMSCE IEEE SB in collaboration with BMSCE IEEE PES is
        proud to present the SIGs!
        <br />
        Taking into consideration your opinions, we will be having the following
        SIGs for this semester: <br />
        1. Python basics <br />
        2. Python Advanced <br />
        3. Intro to Fusion 360 <br />
        4. Arduino <br />
        5. Public Speaking <br />
        <br />
        ‚Ä¢ The registration for the SIGs is open to all students of BMSCE. <br />
        ‚Ä¢ One student can register for only one SIG. Registering for more than
        one SIG will lead to cancellation of seats in all the registered SIGs.{" "}
        <br />
        ‚Ä¢ There are only limited seats for each SIG. <br />
        ‚Ä¢ Seats will be given to potential students based on first come first
        serve basis except for the Python SIG. In case of a tie, preference will
        be given to IEEE members. <br />
        ‚Ä¢ A screening test will be held for both the Python SIGs. <br />
        ‚Ä¢ The student will receive a certificate of course completion at the end
        of the program. <br />
        ‚Ä¢ A safety deposit will have to be made which will be refunded at the
        end of the program on passing the final assessment. <br />
        <br />
        Refundable deposit amount: <br />
